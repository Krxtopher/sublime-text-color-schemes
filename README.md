# Sublime Text 2 Color Schemes

Color schemes for the Sublime Text 2 code editor. To install...

## Superhero

This theme was inspired by my recent exploration of [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), the "Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework". It looks particularly good with the excellent free font, [Komika Text](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Komika-Text), which is shown in the screenshots. If you're not sold on the idea of using a non-monospaced font for coding, it also looks great with my favorite monospaced font, Consolas (installed with the Microsoft Office suite). But you really should give Komika a try. It works surprisingly well!
